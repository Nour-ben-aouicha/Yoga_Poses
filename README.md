# Yoga_Poses
## Yoga Poses Classification using the EfficientNetB0 model architecture from the TensorFlow Keras
In this project, we used the yoga poses dataset from Kaggle in order to build a model able to predict the Yoga poses.
For this, we needed to download a few Python libraries like Tensorflow, keras and sklearn from which we mainly retrieved the model architecture, the preprocessing methods implemented and so on.
You will find at the end of the project the results of the prediction as well as some of the architecture weights and model summary.
And finally, here is the dataset <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/niharika41298/yoga-poses-dataset"\>link.
