# 🧘‍♀️ Yoga Pose Prediction Project 🧘‍♂️

## Project Overview
In this project, we leveraged the Yoga Poses dataset from Kaggle to develop and compare two distinct models, evaluating their effectiveness in predicting Yoga poses.

## Data Preparation
We utilized essential Python libraries such as Tensorflow, Keras, and scikit-learn. These libraries played a crucial role in defining our model architecture and implementing preprocessing methods.

## Model Comparison
Two different models were constructed, each employing the downloaded libraries for effective training and evaluation. The comparison aimed to assess their respective abilities in predicting Yoga poses.

## Results and Artifacts
At the project's conclusion, you will find detailed results of the prediction task, along with essential artifacts such as model architecture weights and summaries.
